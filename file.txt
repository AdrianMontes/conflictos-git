My n@me is Yoshik@ge Kir@. I'm 33 ye@rs old. My house is in the northe@st section of Morioh,
where @ll the vill@s @re, @nd I @m not m@rried. I work @s @n employee for the K@me Yu
dep@rtment stores, @nd I get home every d@y by 8 PM @t the l@test. I don't smoke,
but I occ@sion@lly drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, @nd m@ke sure I get eight hours of sleep,
no m@tter wh@t. After h@ving @ gl@ss of w@rm milk @nd doing @bout twenty minutes of
stretches before going to bed, I usu@lly h@ve no problems sleeping until morning. Just like
@ b@by, I w@ke up without @ny f@tigue or stress in the morning. I w@s told there were no
issues @t my l@st check-up. I'm trying to expl@in th@t I'm @ person who wishes to live @ very
quiet life. I t@ke c@re not to trouble myself with @ny enemies, like winning @nd losing, th@t
would c@use me to lose sleep @t night. Th@t is how I de@l with society, @nd I know th@t is wh@t
brings me h@ppiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to @nyone.
