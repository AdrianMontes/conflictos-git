My nam€ is Yoshikag€ Kira. I'm 33 y€ars old. My hous€ is in th€ north€ast s€ction of Morioh,
wh€r€ all th€ villas ar€, and I am not marri€d. I work as an €mploy€€ for th€ Kam€ Yu
d€partm€nt stor€s, and I g€t hom€ €v€ry day by 8 PM at th€ lat€st. I don't smok€,
but I occasionally drink. I'm in b€d by 11 PM, and mak€ sur€ I g€t €ight hours of sl€€p,
no matt€r what. Aft€r having a glass of warm milk and doing about tw€nty minut€s of
str€tch€s b€for€ going to b€d, I usually hav€ no probl€ms sl€€ping until morning. Just lik€
a baby, I wak€ up without any fatigu€ or str€ss in th€ morning. I was told th€r€ w€r€ no
issu€s at my last ch€ck-up. I'm trying to €xplain that I'm a p€rson who wish€s to liv€ a v€ry
qui€t lif€. I tak€ car€ not to troubl€ mys€lf with any €n€mi€s, lik€ winning and losing, that
would caus€ m€ to los€ sl€€p at night. That is how I d€al with soci€ty, and I know that is what
brings m€ happin€ss. Although, if I w€r€ to fight I wouldn't los€ to anyon€.
